COVID-19 X-Ray Classification Web App using Tensorflow.js

Creating a CNN using Tensorflow.js and the MobileNet model from Keras to classify X-Ray Images as either "Negative" or "Positive" and deploying the model as a Web App on Github.

Data:

The Dataset is from the Kaggle Competition: https://www.kaggle.com/praveengovi/coronahack-chest-xraydataset

Credits: (please give these Engineers a look. I've learnt a lot from their work)

Exploratory Data Analysis was adapted from this competitor - https://www.kaggle.com/digvijayyadav/deep-learning-and-transfer-learning-on-covid-19
